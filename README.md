## Data Pipeline

The `dag_main.py` is an Airflow DAG that runs daily at 8:00 AM to orchestrate the data fetching and processing tasks needed by the ROSTI app.

It performs the following steps:

- Fetches daily weather forecast for the user‚Äôs location and saves it as JSON.
- Generates a swim packing checklist based on the weather forecast.
- Retrieves current lake water temperatures for multiple swim spots.
- Gathers public transport information and estimated travel times from the user‚Äôs city to all swim spots, including route summaries and Google Maps links.
- Shows the latest episodes from curated podcasts for daily recommendations.

All resulting data files are saved in the `src/data/output/` directory and consumed by the Streamlit app to provide up-to-date, personalized recommendations for outdoor swims, transport, and entertainment.

This DAG ensures that all relevant data is fresh and synchronized every day to deliver an optimal user experience.
